https://www.pexels.com/photo/snowy-mountain-1287145/This semester, I studied the DECO7180 course. As part of a course project, I led a web-based project to create a service for dog owners in Brisbane to find dog parks. My responsibilities included coding the entire website, integrating the API, and ensuring the final product adhered to our original concept. I use the portfolio section to showcase my contributions and reflections on the project.

Introduction
This was my journey creating my first portfolio website. It begins with extensive research into the key elements that make a portfolio effective and memorable. I wanted to make sure that my website not only showcased my abilities but also reflected my course contributions, participation and reflection. I focused on what I wanted to highlight, sketching out initial ideas for layout and navigation, aiming for a simple yet eye-catching design. The portfolio not only represents a collection of my past projects, but is a narrative of my contribution to the projects and a testament to my commitment to continuous improvement.
